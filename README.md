# Movie Recommendation System using Restricted Boltzmann Machine for Collaborative Filtering

Introduced a class of two-layer undirected graphical models (RBM’s), suitable for modeling tabular or count data, and presented efficient learning and inference procedures for this class of models.

 We also demonstrated that RBM’s can be successfully applied to a large
dataset containing over 100 million user/movie ratings. When the predictions of multiple RBM models and multiple SVD models are linearly combined, we achieve an error rate that is well over 6% better than the score of Netflix’s own system.
